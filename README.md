This is the Website that I uploaded only front-end side before. Now I uploading the whole files of the project. This is simply a copy of Instagram. I copied many features of Instagram.

I used PHP as a back-end engine and MySQL database. You have to run scripts with a server, and before run the website you have to change database settings according to your databse.
These files also includes my SQL settings, you need to import that to your MySQL database.


Stack:

Php for backend
Vanilla javascript for frontend

No framework :)
